## Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Each project demonstrates a different ML task ‚Äî from image classification to tabular prediction.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fashion MNIST Classifier üëï

A deep learning model to classify grayscale clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Features:

~Data preprocessing and normalization

~One-hot encoding of labels

~Fully connected neural network with dropout layers

~Training with Adam optimizer

~Visualization of learning curves

~Detailed classification report


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Iris Flower Classifier üå∏

A neural network implemented from scratch with NumPy, predicting iris species.

Features:

~Manual forward/backward propagation

~Sigmoid & softmax activations

~Cross-entropy loss

~Gradient descent optimization

~Feature standardization + one-hot encoding

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tabular Predictions: Titanic & House Prices üö¢üè°

A collection of tabular ML tasks focusing on classification (Titanic survival) and regression (House price prediction).

Features

~Handling categorical features with one-hot encoding

~Dealing with missing values (median/mode imputation recommended)

~Fully connected neural network architectures for classification & regression

~Evaluation with accuracy (Titanic) and loss metrics (House Prices)

Issues Identified

Titanic:

Large dataset reduction after dropping missing values (~891 ‚Üí 182 rows)

Redundant/overlapping columns (sex vs who, embarked vs embark_town)

Accuracy ~60‚Äì65%, model not converging well

House Prices:

Wrong output activation (ReLU) for regression ‚Üí should be linear

Unscaled features ‚Üí caused unstable training and huge loss values

Model did not converge

‚úÖ Future Work

Use proper preprocessing (feature scaling, imputation)

Try stronger models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Regularized Regression)

Add Batch Normalization, EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau for neural networks

Perform feature importance analysis

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ MNIST Digit Classifier üî¢

A simple neural network trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

Features:

~Data loaded directly from Keras

~Flatten ‚Üí Dense(128, ReLU) ‚Üí Dense(10, softmax)

~Adam optimizer + sparse categorical crossentropy loss

~Training for 25 epochs (batch size 32)
